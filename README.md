1. **Target Audience (Remains Largely the Same)**
   - Casual Social Gamers (Ages 16-40): Seeking fun, varied, and quick social games.
   - Trivia Enthusiasts: Enjoy testing and expanding their knowledge.
   - Students and Learners: If educational categories are emphasized, this group might use the game as a fun learning/revision tool.

2. **Revenue Generation Strategy (Revised - Single Tier)**
   - Core Game & Features Free: All game modes, core question categories, and gameplay functionalities are available to all players from the start.
   - Advertisements (Primary Sustaining Revenue):
      1. Rewarded Video Ads (Opt-in): Players can choose to watch ads to:
         - Earn a small amount of "Gems" (in-game soft currency for cosmetics).
         - Gain a single "Hint" or "Skip Token" for use in certain game modes (limit per game/day to maintain balance).
         - Temporarily unlock a specific "Featured Quiz Pack of the Day/Week."
      2. Interstitial Ads (Infrequent): Full-screen ads displayed minimally, such as after finishing a complete game session (e.g., after the results screen and before returning to the main lobby), or after playing a set number of public games. Frequency will be carefully managed to avoid disrupting game flow.
   - In-App Purchases (IAP):
      1. Cosmetic Items: A wide variety of player avatars (outfits, hats, accessories), unique profile badges/frames, animated chat emotes, and custom lobby/game background themes. Purchased with "Gems" (earnable via gameplay, daily rewards, or rewarded ads) or directly with real money for exclusive/premium cosmetic sets.
      2. "Ad-Free Access" Pass: A one-time purchase that permanently removes all non-rewarded (interstitial) advertisements from the game for that user.
      3. (Optional) Special Themed Quiz Packs: While most categories are free, occasional high-value, professionally curated, or licensed IP-based quiz packs could be offered as a one-time purchase or unlockable with a significant amount of "Gems." The availability of free content will always be vast.
   - Daily Rewards: Encourage daily login by offering a small amount of "Gems" or a "Hint Token." Can include an option to "double reward by watching an ad."
   - **Positioning (Reiteration):** A fun, feature-rich, and fair-to-play social trivia platform. All players get the full gameplay experience. Monetization is focused on player expression (cosmetics), convenience (ad-removal), and entirely optional content, ensuring no pay-to-win elements.
